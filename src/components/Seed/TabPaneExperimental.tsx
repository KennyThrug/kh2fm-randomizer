				<Typography>Known issues with Boss Randomizer:</Typography>

				<ul>
					<li>Sometimes the seed can take 4-5 seconds to be made after hitting the download button. In this case it's likely a lot of the bosses won't be randomized, so it's suggested to make a new seed in this case</li>
					<li>Bosses wait a different amount of time before their first attack, so in some cases you will get attacked before gaining control</li>
					<li>When Scar hits non-lion Sora with his lunge attack it will temporarily put Sora in a tpose.</li>
					<li>The game will softlock if Mickey is summoned against Marluxia and the doom counter hits 0.</li>
				</ul>

				<Typography>Current boss fights in the pool:</Typography>

				<ul>
					{bosses.map(boss => (
						<li key={boss.description}>{boss.description}</li>
					))}
